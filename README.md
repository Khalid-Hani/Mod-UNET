# Thesis Title
**"Automatic Primary Hepatic Tumors Segmentation in CT Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks"**

## Thesis Aim
The primary aim of this thesis was to develop a reliable algorithm for automatic segmentation of hepatic tumors using convolutional neural networks. The algorithm was designed to detect and segment the location, size, and spread of hepatic tumors, with the goal of saving time and effort for radiologists.

## Novelty in the Work
The unique contribution of this work is the creation of a liver tumor-specific machine-learning segmentation algorithm based on a modified U-Net derivative. The algorithm was developed through experimentation with different approaches, and it demonstrated decent and reliable performance.
